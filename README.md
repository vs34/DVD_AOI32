# AOI32 Circuit & Layout Design

This project showcases the **transistor-level design** and **layout implementation** of an AOI32 logic gate using Cadence Virtuoso. It includes both *complex* and *non-complex* layout styles, along with simulations and documentation.

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- **Cadence Virtuoso** – schematic & layout design  
- **Eldo** – simulation  
- **.cir** files – circuit netlists for AOI32 and its variants
